Title: Sentiment Analysis Scorer
Version: 0.1-2
Description: Sentiment analysis is a popular technique in text mining.  Roughly
    speaking, the technique is an attempt to determine the overall emotional
    attitude of a piece of text (i.e., positive or negative).  We provide a new
    implementation of a common method for computing sentiment, whereby words are
    scored as positive or negative according to a "dictionary", and then an
    sum of those scores for the document is produced.  We use the 'Hu' and 'Liu'
    sentiment dictionary for determining sentiment.  The scoring function is
    'vectorized' by document, and scores for multiple documents are computed in
    parallel via 'OpenMP'.
