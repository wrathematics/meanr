Title: Sentiment Analysis Scorer
Version: 0.1-6
Description: Sentiment analysis is a popular technique in text mining that
    attempts to determine the emotional state of some text. We provide a new
    implementation of a common method for computing sentiment, whereby words are
    scored as positive or negative according to a dictionary lookup. Then the
    sum of those scores is returned for the document. We use the 'Hu' and 'Liu'
    sentiment dictionary ('Hu' and 'Liu', 2004) <doi:10.1145/1014052.1014073>
    for determining sentiment. The scoring function is 'vectorized' by document,
    and scores for multiple documents are computed in parallel via 'OpenMP'.
